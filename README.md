Using random forest to classify NBA players by position 

The advent of small ball lineups and guards is changing not only changing how the game is played but also player evaluation and in game decision making. Most teams are playing at faster tempos from young startup teams in Brooklyn and Phoenix to heavyweights including Golden State and Houston. This means that even power forwards and centers are expected to run the floor and produce on short possessions. 

In turn, the game of basketball is no longer played at five positions. Researchers are using machine learning to unearth player and ball movement patterns among teams. In this spirit, we used random forest and support machine vectors (SVM) to classify NBA player by position using advanced data from the 2016-2017 regular season.
